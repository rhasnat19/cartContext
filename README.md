# cartContext
In this project,
I am covering component compositions, Redux Context API and and reducer.

as, component composition shouldn't be used, as this just make a wrapper. nothing else.

useContext can also be used as <ItemName>.consumer. but this make code combursome, so we avoid using this. but also we should
go for the approach using in product file. useContext and pass context to this. and so on.
